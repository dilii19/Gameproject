  The game gets worse and worse every year and there are 2 key reasons behind this. The first is neglect. A company that is obsessed with milking its fanbase with fake currency in what is essentially a pay to win method exploited on children is EA Sports main goal. Do they care about the gameplay?</p>

  Fc take care of all the YouTubers who promote coins and buy coins without being banned! They ban everyone else but give these guys a pass. They promote coins on every video and get filmed at Ea Fc events this is a total scam and people who put money into this game have never got the opportunity to get the best players.
