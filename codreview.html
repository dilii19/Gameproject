  call of duty is a fun game. I played the 2 day f2p trial. In that, i played Multiplayer and Zombies (via the Activities board on my PS5). I cant say for the campaign as it didn't let me even touch it, which is fair. </p>

  UPDATE: For those Sledgehammer employees I mean, totally real players whose Google account is two months old and Vanguard is the only review they ever posted (totally not suspicious) this is for you.

The campaign was short but it was thrilling I rate the campaign a 4.5/5
Multiplayer is where I think this game shines it has more content at launch than Cold War. They brought back a few og maps from world at war( dome and castle) the pacing option is fun a new and needs to be worked on alittle but itâ€™s a great new feature and u can play the pacing that suits your play style.
